CEMS is a comprehensive and user-friendly information system designed to centralize and optimize the management of tests within a college environment. The system aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in handling various test-related activities, including test creation, administration, grading, and information processing.

## System Overview

The CEMS system offers a range of features to facilitate test-related tasks, including:

1. Test Creation:
   - Lecturers can create and maintain a database of questions specific to the subjects they teach.
   - Each question is uniquely identified and contains relevant text, multiple-choice answers (with one correct answer), and the lecturer's details.

2. Exam Preparation:
   - Lecturers can compose tests by selecting questions from the question database.
   - Each test is assigned a unique identifier and includes information such as subject, course, duration, points per question, and optional instructions for examinees and lecturers.

3. Test Administration:
   - Tests can be conducted either manually or through a computerized interface.
   - In the manual method, students enter a test code provided by the lecturer, receive a Word file to complete outside the system, and submit the file back to the system within the specified time frame.
   - In the computerized method, students access the test directly within the system, submit their answers electronically, and the system automatically enforces the allotted time limit.

4. Test Management:
   - Lecturers have the ability to lock a test at any point, preventing additional examinees from accessing it.
   - The system automatically locks a test once all participating examinees have submitted their solutions.
   - Lecturers can request temporary time changes for a specific test, subject to the approval of the department head.

5. Test Evaluation:
   - Computerized tests are automatically graded by the system based on predefined criteria.
   - Lecturers review and confirm the system-generated grades, with the option to include comments or manually adjust grades as necessary.
   - Students can access their graded tests, along with any additional comments provided by the lecturer, through the system.
   - The system sends automated email and SMS notifications to students, informing them when their grades are available.

6. Information Processing:
   - The system generates and stores statistical information for each conducted test, including average scores, median scores, and score distribution.
   - The system also performs automated checks on submitted copies to identify any potential identity errors, notifying the respective lecturer for further verification.
